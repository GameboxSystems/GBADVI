<msg type="warning" file="Pack" num="1653" delta="new" >At least one timing constraint is impossible to meet because component delays alone exceed the constraint. A timing constraint summary below shows the failing constraints (preceded with an Asterisk (*)). Please use the Timing Analyzer (GUI) or TRCE (command line) with the Mapped NCD and PCF files to identify which constraints and paths are failing because of the component delays alone. If the failing path(s) is mapped to Xilinx components as expected, consider relaxing the constraint. If it is not mapped to components as expected, re-evaluate your HDL and how synthesis is optimizing the path. To allow the tools to bypass this error, set the environment variable XIL_TIMING_ALLOW_IMPOSSIBLE to 1.


For more information about the Timing Analyzer, consult the Xilinx Timing Analyzer Reference manual; for more information on TRCE, consult the Xilinx Command Line Tools User Guide &quot;TRACE&quot; chapter.
